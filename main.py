    Before diving into code, I spent 10 years as a chef in Mexico 🌵 — a career that shaped my creativity, precision, and attention to detail.  
    Today, I bring that same mindset to software development, building real-world tools and internal systems for a construction company while continuously expanding my skills through personal projects.

    The 🌮 in my logo represents my roots and my approach to coding: craft, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

    This portfolio is not just a collection of projects — it’s a real product.

    I built a full backend with FastAPI, deployed it to the cloud, and connected it to real external APIs to work with live data, not mock examples. The frontend runs on Streamlit so I can turn ideas into working tools quickly.

    The goal isn’t just to show code, but to show how I design systems, integrate third-party services, and turn raw data into something useful, interactive, and real.
